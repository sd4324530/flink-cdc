# Flink CDC AI Agent Instructions

This file provides guidance for AI coding agents working with the Apache Flink CDC.

## Prerequisites

- Java 11 (baseline; all code must compile and run on Java 11) and Java 17
- Maven 3.8.6 or higher
- Git
- Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, WSL)
- Docker (required for running integration tests and e2e tests)

## Commands

### Build

- Fast dev build (skip tests and format checks): `mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dspotless.check.skip=true -Dcheckstyle.skip=true`
- Full build against Flink 1.x (default): `mvn clean package -DskipTests`
- Full build against Flink 2.x: `mvn clean install -DskipTests` (default line first), then install the 2.2-line artifacts with `mvn install -Prelease-flink2.2 -pl flink-cdc-dist,flink-cdc-connect/flink-cdc-source-connectors/flink-sql-connector-mysql-cdc,flink-cdc-connect/flink-cdc-pipeline-connectors -DskipTests` (no `-am`: the 2.2 profile swaps guava31 for guava33 whose shaded package names differ, so main modules must NOT be recompiled under it; the default-line install provides them)
- Single module (e.g. `flink-cdc-common`): `mvn clean package -DskipTests -pl flink-cdc-common -am`

### Testing

- Run all tests for a module: `mvn verify -pl flink-cdc-common`
- Run all tests against Flink 2.x: `mvn verify -pl flink-cdc-flink/flink-cdc-flink-2.2 -am` (version module: own tests + rerun suites of main modules against the 2.2 artifacts)
- Run a single test class: `mvn -pl flink-cdc-common -Dtest=MyTest test`
- Run a single test method: `mvn -pl flink-cdc-common -Dtest=MyTest#myMethod test`

### Code Quality

- Before committing changes, run `mvn spotless:apply` and `mvn spotless:check` to enforce code style rules.
- Make sure newly added files have proper ASF license headers.
- Release-line sanity (per-Flink-version modules FLIP): `tools/ci/verify-release-line.sh <flink1.20|flink2.2>` asserts line-correct packaging, and `tools/ci/verify-adapter-contract.sh` asserts that same-FQCN adapters in both version modules expose identical public signatures. Both run in nightly CI; run them locally after touching version modules or adapters (they need both modules' jars installed or packaged first).

## Repository Structure

Flink CDC is organized around the Pipeline abstraction: a user-defined data pipeline that reads from one or more sources, optionally transforms records, and writes to one or more sinks. The core modules implement this abstraction; the connector modules provide the concrete source and sink implementations.

### Core Modules

- `flink-cdc-common` — Shared API and data model used across all modules: CDC event types (`DataChangeEvent`, `SchemaChangeEvent`, etc.), the schema model, data types, source/sink interfaces, `Factory` SPI, route definitions, UDF interfaces, and utility classes. Most new abstractions start here.
- `flink-cdc-runtime` — Runtime implementation of the Pipeline: operators for reading, routing, transforming (expression evaluation via Calcite + Janino), and writing CDC events.
- `flink-cdc-composer` — Pipeline assembly and deployment layer. Translates a `PipelineDefinition` into a runnable Flink job, wiring sources, operators, and sinks together. Supports Flink-native, Kubernetes, and YARN deployment.
- `flink-cdc-cli` — Command-line entry point (`flink-cdc.sh`). Parses YAML pipeline definitions and delegates to `flink-cdc-composer`.
- `flink-cdc-dist` — Distribution packaging. Produces the `flink-cdc-<version>-bin` release archive.

### Flink Version Compatibility

Currently, Flink CDC supports two Flink generations simultaneously through per-Flink-version
version modules under `flink-cdc-flink/`:

- `flink-cdc-flink-1.20` — Flink 1.20 baseline version module (adapters, backports, version tests). Default profile.
- `flink-cdc-flink-2.2` — Flink 2.2 version module (adapters, shadow classes, version tests, and rerun suites of main modules' core tests). Built on the default line; bound into 2.2-line artifacts via `-Prelease-flink2.2`.

See `flink-cdc-flink/DIVERGENCE-INVENTORY.md` for the per-class divergence inventory and the
FLIP at the repo root (`FLIP-per-flink-version-modules.md`) for the target architecture.

All modules that depend on Flink APIs must declare their Flink dependencies as `provided` and reference `${flink.version}`, which is anchored to the Flink 1.20 baseline in the root pom; per-Flink-version code lives in the version modules under `flink-cdc-flink/`, and release lines are produced with the `-Prelease-flink<version>` packaging profiles.
Please verify your changes in both Flink 1.20 (LTS) and Flink 2.x (latest).

### Connectors (`flink-cdc-connect/`)

Connectors are split into two categories:

- Source Connectors (`flink-cdc-connect/flink-cdc-source-connectors/`) are CDC sources for DataStream and Flink SQL jobs.
- Pipeline Connectors (`flink-cdc-connect/flink-cdc-pipeline-connectors/`) are Pipeline connectors for the YAML API.

### Tests

Write unit tests and integration tests in the corresponding submodules. End-to-end tests are located in these modules:

- `flink-cdc-e2e-tests/` — End-to-end tests parent module.
  - `flink-cdc-e2e-utils` — Shared test utilities (container management, assertions)
  - `flink-cdc-source-e2e-tests` — E2E tests for source connectors
  - `flink-cdc-pipeline-e2e-tests` — E2E tests for pipeline connectors

### Documentation

- `docs/` — Docusaurus documentation site on master. `docs/content/` for English, `docs/i18n/zh/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/` for Chinese. Update both when adding new features. Historical release branches retain Hugo.

## Coding Standards

- **Format Java files with Spotless before every commit:** `mvn spotless:apply`.
- **Import order** (enforced by Checkstyle): `org.apache.flink.cdc` → `org.apache.flink` → other third-party → `javax` → `java`. Static imports go last. No star imports.
- **Forbidden imports** (enforced by Checkstyle):
  - JUnit 4 (`org.junit.*` except `org.junit.jupiter.*`) — use JUnit 5 Jupiter instead
  - `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions` and `org.hamcrest` — use AssertJ instead
  - `com.google.common.*` — use `flink-shaded-guava` instead
  - `com.google.common.base.Preconditions` — use Flink CDC's `Preconditions`
  - `com.google.common.annotations.VisibleForTesting` — use `@VisibleForTesting` from `org.apache.flink.cdc.common.annotation`
- **API stability annotations:** User-facing API types should carry stability annotations, and methods/fields/constructors only need explicit annotations when they differ from the enclosing type or when needed.
  - `@Public` — stable across major versions
  - `@PublicEvolving` — may change in minor versions
  - `@Experimental` — may change at any time
  - `@Internal` — no stability guarantee; users should not depend on it
- **Logging:** Use SLF4J with parameterized placeholders (`LOG.info("foo {}", bar)`), never string concatenation.
- **Braces:** Always use braces for `if`/`else`/`for`/`while`/`do` blocks.
- **Comments:** All comments should be written in English, and keep it concise. Only write comments when necessary. Avoid trivial `@param`, `@return` comments in JavaDocs.
- Apache License 2.0 header required on all new files.

## Testing Standards

- Use **JUnit 5** (`org.junit.jupiter`) and **AssertJ** (`org.assertj.core.api.Assertions`) for all new tests. Do not use JUnit 4 or Hamcrest.
- Test classes are **package-private** (no `public` modifier on the class).
- **Unit tests** are named `*Test.java` (e.g., `SchemaUtilsTest`).
- **Integration tests** (requiring Docker / real databases) are named `*ITCase.java` (e.g., `MySqlSourceITCase`).
- Add tests for new behavior, covering success, failure, and edge cases. Tests should be self-explanatory; avoid verbose comments in test classes.
- For bug fixes, verify the new test fails without the fix before confirming it passes with it.

## Commits and PRs

### Commit message format

- `[FLINK-XXXX][component] Description` where `FLINK-XXXX` is the JIRA issue number and `component` is the affected area (e.g. `connect/mysql`, `pipeline-connector/kafka`, `docs`, `runtime`)
- `[hotfix][component] ...` or `[docs][component] ...` for trivial fixes without a JIRA issue
- `[ci] Description` for CI-only changes

### Pull request conventions

- Title format mirrors the commit message: `[FLINK-XXXX][component] Title`
- A corresponding JIRA issue is required (except trivial changes)
- Fill out the PR template completely: describe purpose, change log, testing approach, and documentation impact
- Ensure CI passes before requesting review
- Enable GitHub Actions on your fork before opening a PR
- When AI tools were used, check the AI disclosure checkbox and uncomment the `Generated-by` line in the PR template, per [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html)

## Boundaries

### Ask first

- Adding or changing `@Public` or `@PublicEvolving` annotations (user-facing API commitments)
- New dependencies
- Large cross-module refactors
- Changes to serialization formats or checkpoint behavior
- Changes to hot paths that could impact performance (per-record processing, state access)

### Never

- Commit secrets, credentials, or tokens
- Push directly to `apache/flink-cdc`; always work from your fork
- Mix unrelated changes into one PR
- Use JUnit 4 or Hamcrest in new test code
- Use `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions`; use AssertJ instead
- Add `Co-Authored-By` with an AI agent in commit messages; use `Generated-by: <Tool Name and Version>` instead
